# Welcome to Youtify! 
Youtify is a web app that puts your favorite YouTube and Spotify playlists in the same place, which breaks the need of switching back and forth between the apps when updating playlists. I am building this because I hate having to go between apps to create new playlists in Spotify that I have on YouTube. When the lists are in the same place you can easily replicate the playlist. One of the core features is functionality that adds a youtube playlist to your Spotify list.
